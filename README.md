# RNAseq-Drosophila-parasitoids
RNAseq analysis of four closely related Drosophila species and two lines of D. melanogaster
experimentally selected for increased resistance after parasitization in two time points (5 and 50 hours). 
These samples are compared against non parasitized control samples. Each sample consisted of three biological replicates.
The samples were collected in the summer of 2011 and sequenced in 2012 in Illumina Hiseq2000, paired end 2x100.
